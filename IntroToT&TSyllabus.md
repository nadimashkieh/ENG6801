### Course Description
The Introduction to Text and Technology course is the core introductory course in the Texts and Technologies Ph.D. program. Its goal is to familiarize students with core concepts that will recur throughout the T&T program, and which form the theoretical basis and backbone of the program. In addition to engaging with theoretical content from a variety of scholars working in T&T-related fields, you will also learn applied skills this semester that will aid in our understanding and application of digital theories and methodologies. Our approach to understanding digital scholarship will be experimental and ambitious; expect to learn some basic digital literacy skills, but also expect to revise and iterate through different ideas as they evolve with your knowledge and interests.

#### Mock Comprehensive Exam:

This exam is practice for the comprehensive exams students will take once their coursework in T&T is complete.  This exam aims to check students’ understanding  of Texts and Technology as a field of knowledge as measured by the texts students read in class and prepared exam summaries for.

Students should  answer the questions below and respond to each thoroughly with an essay that displays their knowledge and has appropriate development and details. Each essay should be a minimum of six pages in length. Please include the question at the beginning of each response essay. Double-space your responses, use a 12-point font, and insert page numbers.

2. What is interdisciplinarity? How is your work interdisciplinary? Use at least four authors in your response. 

## Schedule

# Hack Section or Digital Assignments:
In order to improve the student digital skills and as part of T&T core technology sequence 20% of the course grade will be dedicated to two technical assignments:

##  1- Mind Map Assignment (5 points):
students will be working on developing the paper ideas, methods and hypothesis using Mind Map: **https://www.xmind.net/**
The map should include the paper topic, research method, research questions and hypothesis, the sample, the audience you think might be interested in this topic, and potential journal or conference to Publish.

## 2- T&T Conferences Collection Website (15 points):
Through the semester students will be introduced to many conferences in this course and in other courses and email announcements. In this assignment using simple HTML students will help in building a collaborative library that includes many conferences that will be published and shared with all T&T students and faculty. Each student is required to bring only 3 conferences from their choice then add them under the T&T track that will be more relevant to these conferences. The website has a template has a separate page for each track:
* Digital Humanities 
* Digital Media
* Editing, Publishing
* Interdisciplinary Curating (EPIC)
* Public History
* Rhetoric and Composition
* Scientific and Technical Communication.

 For each conference, the student is required to write the conference type, date, place, submission requirement, overall summary of its activities, and finally link to the conference website if possible. After the end of the semester, students are encouraged to keep editing this website since it will be a very useful conference source for all T&T departments.
