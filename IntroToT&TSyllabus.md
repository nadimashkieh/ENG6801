#### Course Description
In addition to the official description published in Graduate Catalog, you should include an overview of the scope and purpose of the course. Additionally, you must include specific, measurable learning objectives that: are consistent with the scope and purpose of the course and tie as clearly as possible to course assignments and activities.
#### Required Materials
This should include required texts as well as other applicable materials (if any).

**Course Policies**
**Attendance**
The expectation is for students to be in every class, on time. Classes are absolutely essential to success in the course. If you cannot be at a class, let me know before-hand. The following types of absences are allowed upon previous notification: 
 
- Religious holidays.
- Authorized UCF or academic events.
- Legal obligations.
 
**Classroom Behavoior, Violence and Harassment**
Respect between everyone in class is expected. It’s assumed that everyone in class has academic freedom, which means that ideas and positions, even unpopular ones, can be expressed. What comes with that, though, is a need for both respect and empathy for others, as well as an openness to ideas that may not directly align with your own. 
 

**Late Papers**
On late papers in general: The due dates are firm. There will be penalties for late papers. If there is a legitimate reason for a paper being late, I am willing to consider it and waive the late penalty. Unacceptable reasons include:
·"I had too much work" (you could have started earlier) 
·"My computer deleted my file" (make back-ups) 
·"I'm on a team and we were away" (work that out with your coach, not me) 
·"I couldn't think of a topic" (come & see me early) 
·"I just procrastinated - it's a problem for me" (if you know this is a problem, plan ahead to deal with it) 
 
**Copmunication of Grade**
Grade reporting to students will happen through Webcourses, in all course modalities. The university follows the national FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) code, which does not allow the communication of grades to a student by email (including embedding them in documents, which means they cannot be placed on a paper emailed to me), or by posting them outside a professor's door. This is a confidentiality issue.
 
**General Communication with Students**
Contact will be through Webcourses or through email. All communication between student and instructor and between student and student should be respectful and professional. Knightsmail is the only official student email at UCF. Class rosters list Knightsmail addresses rather than external email addresses, and all official class communications will be sent only to the Knightsmail addresses. Students are responsible for checking their Knightsmail accounts regularly. See the [FAQ](https://knightsemail.ucf.edu/FAQ/) for further information. Generally, you can expect a response for emails within two school days.
 
**Academic Honesty** 
As with all matters of student conduct, academic honesty is governed by the "Golden Rule". We will discuss the nature of academic honesty in class, but a note here is warranted. Basically, your work should be your own and original to this class, and when you are drawing on the words, images, or ideas of others, this should be properly noted.

**Disability Access** 
The University of Central Florida is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. This syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course must contact the professor at the beginning of the semester to discuss needed accommodations. No accommodations will be provided until the student has met with the professor to request accommodations. Students who need accommodations must be registered with Student Disability Services, Student Resource Center Room 132, phone (407) 823-2371, TTY/TDD only phone (407) 823-2116, or [via this URL](https://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/), before requesting accommodations from the professor.
 
**Financial Aid Reporting** 
All faculty are required to document students’ academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete the following academic activity by the end of the first week of classes or as soon as possible after adding the course: MODULE 1 QUIZ. Failure to do so may result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.
 
**Controvertial Content** 
Many of my courses deal with issues in contemporary culture. Occasionally, there may be controversial content - concepts, images, opinions - that we will consider. If you feel uncomfortable with this, please let me know and we can try to make accommodations, but everyone should be aware that the nature of the humanities studies is to consider a wide range of ideas and images, some of which will be offensive to some people. The goal is not to endorse these ideas, but to understand and analyze them. Academic freedom extends to everyone in the class, but so does academic responsibility and compassion. 
 
**Drop/Swap, Withdrawal, Acadaemic Calendar** 
It is the student's responsibility to drop or withdraw from the course if there is an unavoidable conflict or if the need should arise for another reason. Students who fail to drop before the deadline established in the curriculum catalogue will receive an F for the course. All dates relevant to this term are available in the academic calendar, [located here.](https://calendar.ucf.edu/)
 
**Copyright**
The course may contain copyrighted materials. These materials are made available to students through the Fair Use doctrine to enhance the learning environment. Please do not copy, duplicate, download, or distribute these materials.
 
**Mandatory Reporting and UCF Care**
Professors have the responsibility to report any information regarding sexual misconduct or crimes happening on campus by contacting UCF student support agency. For more information, visit UCFCares.com, email at ucfcares@ucf.edu, or call (407) 823-5607. Counseling available 24/7 at (407) 823-2811 (then press #5).
 
**Campuis Saftey**
Familiarize yourself with the emergency procedures posted near the classroom door, and with exits in the building. In case of emergency, call 911. You can sign up for UCF alerts at my.ucf.edu through Student Self Service.

## Schedule
The minimum required here is due dates for major assignments and exams/assessments; method(s) for submitting assignments; and the date and format of the final exam. You may want to add information on withdrawal dates or other events.

# Hack Section or Digital Assignments:
In order to improve the student digital skills and as part of T&T core technology sequence 20% of the course grade will be dedicated to two technical assignments:

##  1- Mind Map Assignment (5 points):
students will be working on developing the paper ideas, methods and hypothesis using Mind Map: **https://www.xmind.net/**
The map should include the paper topic, research method, research questions and hypothesis, the sample, the audience you think might be interested in this topic, and potential journal or conference to Publish.

## 2- T&T Conferences Collection Website (15 points):
Through the semester students will be introduced to many conferences in this course and in other courses and email announcements. In this assignment using simple HTML students will help in building a collaborative library that includes many conferences that will be published and shared with all T&T students and faculty. Each student is required to bring only 3 conferences from their choice then add them under the T&T track that will be more relevant to these conferences. The website has a template has a separate page for each track:
* Digital Humanities 
* Digital Media
* Editing, Publishing
* Interdisciplinary Curating (EPIC)
* Public History
* Rhetoric and Composition
* Scientific and Technical Communication.

 For each conference, the student is required to write the conference type, date, place, submission requirement, overall summary of its activities, and finally link to the conference website if possible. After the end of the semester, students are encouraged to keep editing this website since it will be a very useful conference source for all T&T departments.
